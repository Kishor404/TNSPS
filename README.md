## Overview

The **Tamil Nadu Smart Patrol System (TNSPS)** is an AI-powered patrol assistance system designed to improve police patrolling efficiency and coverage. The system allows police officers to mark high-risk areas on a map and automatically generates optimized patrol routes that cover all critical zones within a given radius.

Unlike traditional static patrol routes, TNSPS generates a **new optimized route each time**, reducing predictability and increasing patrol effectiveness.
